# BeavKat

Exploring AI-enhanced, family-friendly games that spark joy, creativity, and meaningful connection.

Our vision is to build worlds that are safe, wholesome, and genuinely fun — experiences that families can share and grow through together.

## 🌱 What BeavKat Is

BeavKat is a small, indie studio-in-progress focused on:

- **Wholesome, family-friendly games**  
- **Co-play experiences** for parents and kids  
- **Value-centered stories** (kindness, courage, stewardship, honesty)  
- **Thoughtful use of AI** for creativity and storytelling, not addiction

This repository is the **home base** for the studio:
strategy notes, roadmaps, references, and links to individual game and tooling repos.

## 🎮 Current Focus – Round 1 Exploration

We are in a 12-week exploration phase:

- Prototyping a **small, cozy web-based game** for families  
- Experimenting with **virtue-based mechanics** (e.g., kindness & courage challenges)  
- Testing **light AI features** for story and character variation  
- Evaluating future directions:
  - AI NPC / dialogue engine
  - AI game asset tools
  - Family-friendly game experiences

This repo will track:
- Vision docs  
- High-level roadmap  
- Design notes  
- Links to prototype repositories (coming soon)

## 📁 Repository Layout (planned)

- `docs/` – studio vision, design notes, decision logs  
- `roadmap/` – 12-week exploration plan, milestones  
- `assets/` – logos, branding, moodboards, non-game art  
- `links.md` – pointers to game + tool repos

*(Folders will evolve as the studio grows.)*

## 🤝 Collaboration

In this phase, BeavKat is primarily an exploration project.
As prototypes mature, we may invite:

- Indie game developers  
- Artists & illustrators  
- Narrative designers  
- Parents & educators for playtesting  

If you’re aligned with the mission and curious about future collaboration, feel free to reach out.
